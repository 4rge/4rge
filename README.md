# Hi, Iâ€™m @ZZZlax #

---

### I work mostly with **python** and **BASH** ###
##### and a little with _php_, _Html5_, _css_ and _javascript_. #####

---

My main focus is on system optimization and automation.
For this reason you will likely see repo's come and go here, evolve and become more efficent.

---

*_I am self taught_*
For the good, and the bad that comes with that. Therefore, I am highly receptive to correction and critique and collaboration.
If you want to get involved in any of my projects, or want me to get involved with yours, the answer is 'yes.'
Just send me a message and we can get started right away.
