## I work mostly with **python** and **BASH**... ##
#### ...and a little with _php_, _Html5_, _markdown_, _css_ and _javascript_. ####

***

My main focus is on system optimization &amp; automation.

For this reason you will likely see repo's come and go here, evolve and become more efficent, very quickly.

***

**_I am self taught_**

For the good, &amp; the bad that comes with that.

Therefore, I am highly receptive to correction &amp; critique and collaboration.

If you want to get involved in any of my projects, or want me to get involved with yours, the answer is 'yes.'

Send me a message &amp; we can get started right away.

* **_"Measure twice, cut once."_**

* **_"You don't get points for difficulty."_**

* **_"It will be there tommorow, get some sleep."_**
